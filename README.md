A Software Engineer specializing in JavaScript technologies and AWS. Professional experience with the technologies listed in the **toolbox** below.

I create tech content, mostly about Web Development and JavaScript, **but** I also talk about other topics than coding. I'd advise you to subscribe to stay up-to-date!

I managed to create an online presence with my [Blog](https://catalins.tech) and [YouTube](https://catalins.tech/youtube) channel, which are accessed by more than 3500 people monthly. Looking forward to reaching and helping more people by sharing my knowledge.
